<!--realized i needed this and added it utilising code from users.html-->
<!---was having issue with my form...Hs needed capitalization below
because it connects to the code near top of helpTickets.js-->
<template>
            <h1>${message}</h1>
             <compose show.bind="showHelpTicketEditForm" view="./components/editHelpTicket.html"></compose>
        <compose show.bind="!showHelpTicketEditForm" view="./components/tableHelpTickets.html"></compose>
    </template>

<!--the above should be correct, however if there is an issue with helpTicketEditForm somewhere else, then it may not work-->
